# Sora 2 Invite Codes Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 14 application for sharing Sora 2 invite codes. The project uses:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel KV (Upstash Redis) for production data persistence
- Local file storage for development

## Code Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE with underscores (e.g., `API_ENDPOINT`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `calculateScore`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `InviteCodeDisplay`, `SubmitCodeModal`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for pages, PascalCase for components (e.g., `how-it-works`, `InviteCodeDisplay.tsx`)

### TypeScript Rules
- Always use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object shapes (e.g., `InviteCode`, `AnalyticsData`)
- Prefer `type` for unions and primitives
- Use strict null checks and optional chaining
- Export types and interfaces from `lib/data.ts`

### React/Next.js Patterns
- Use 'use client' directive for client components
- Prefer Server Components when possible
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use React hooks properly with dependency arrays

### API Routes
- Always validate request data
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement error handling with try-catch
- Log important operations for debugging
- Use NextRequest and NextResponse types

### Data Management
- All data operations go through `lib/data.ts`
- Use `persistenceManager` for storage operations
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Handle async operations with proper error handling
- Use consistent data structures across the app

## File Structure Rules

### Components
- Place reusable components in `components/` directory
- Use descriptive component names
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper accessibility attributes
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

### API Routes
- Place API routes in `app/api/` directory
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Implement proper request/response handling
- Include proper error responses
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Data Layer
- Core data types in `lib/data.ts`
- Storage adapters in `lib/persistence.ts`
- Utility functions in `lib/` directory
- Keep data structures consistent and well-documented

## Security Guidelines
- Never expose sensitive data in client-side code
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication for admin routes
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Sanitize data before storing in database

## Performance Guidelines
- Use Next.js Image optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize database queries and storage operations

## SEO and Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper meta tags and structured data
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use descriptive alt text for images

## Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Implement fallback UI for errors
- Use proper HTTP status codes

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Different storage adapters for dev/prod
- Proper error handling for missing env vars
- Document required environment variables

## Game Logic Rules
- Global Best scores only update when new score is higher
- Personal Best scores only update when new score is higher
- Implement proper user identification for personal scores
- Use consistent scoring algorithms
- Handle edge cases in game logic

## Database/Storage Rules
- Use Vercel KV for production (Upstash Redis)
- Use local file storage for development
- Implement proper data serialization/deserialization
- Use retry mechanisms for network operations
- Implement proper data validation

## Code Comments
- Use Chinese comments for business logic explanations
- Use English for technical implementation details
- Comment complex algorithms and data transformations
- Document API endpoints and their purposes
- Include TODO comments for future improvements

## Testing Considerations
- Write testable code with pure functions
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement proper test data setup
- Use consistent test naming conventions

## Deployment Rules
- Ensure production builds are optimized
- Test all environment variables are set
- Verify database connections work
- Check all API endpoints are functional
- Ensure proper error handling in production

## Git and Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use meaningful branch names
- Include relevant issue numbers in commits

## Performance Monitoring
- Log important operations for monitoring
- Implement proper error tracking
- Monitor database performance
- Track user engagement metrics
- Monitor API response times

Remember: This project serves the Sora 2 community by providing a platform to share invite codes. Keep user experience as the top priority while maintaining code quality and security.
